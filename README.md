# 📳 Haptic-Beat

**Haptic-Beat** is an Android application built using **Kotlin** that generates synchronized haptic (vibration) feedback based on music beats and audio rhythm. The goal of this project is to create an immersive tactile experience where users can *feel* the beat of the music through their device.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**
- **Android SDK**
- **Android Haptic / Vibration APIs**
- **Audio Signal Processing (Basic Beat Detection)**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Android device or emulator with vibration support
- Minimum Android version as defined in the project

---

### Installation
git clone https://github.com/rathodpratham-dev/Haptic-Beat.git

1. Open the project in **Android Studio**
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Connect an Android device or start an emulator
4. Run the app

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The application analyzes audio data to detect beats or intensity changes. When a beat is detected, a vibration pattern is triggered using Android’s haptic feedback system, allowing users to feel the rhythm in real time.
